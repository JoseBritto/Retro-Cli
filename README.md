# Retro Cli

I built this terminal for a friend to be used as an easter egg in his project.
The actual version is available [here](https://darshan701.github.io/H_terminal/).  
I removed the login functionality and added a command to explain why I built this to showcase it [here](https://cli.britto.tech)

All effects and visuals are written in pure css. No images or libraries are used.
And the terminal is written from scratch using vanilla js.
